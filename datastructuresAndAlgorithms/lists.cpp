// LISTS:
//  -   Stores a given number of elements of a given data-type.
//      -   Able to declare in array parameter.
//  -   Declare what type(s) of data are being passed.
//  -   Write/Modify element at position.
//  -   Read element at a position.
//  -   Abstract data type as is (for reasons as mentioned), because it merely molds
//      or shapes the data as intended, but doesn't perform functionality (30,000ft view)
//      -   Access to read/write data requires const time.
//          -   If last index of data manipulated, then O(1) time taken, because no other data is affected.
//          -   If any other index of data is manipulated, then O(x) time taken, where x is number of other
//              items in array/list affected
