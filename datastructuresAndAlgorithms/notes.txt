Data Structures:
    -   Way to structure data to retrieve/use effectively
    -   Two Types of Data Sets:
        -   Mathamatical/logical levels (Abstract data type [ADT]):
                -   High level, theory of how/why data is structured in such a Way
                -   EX:
                    -   List (Array) of how data is laid out and interacting with model.
        -   Implimentation (Concrete Type):
                -   Code in action; the way it is executed and performs.
                -   EX:
                    -   Linked Lists, Tree, Queue, Stack

    - Need to Analyze Data Structure in 4 Terms:
        -   Logical View
        -   Operations
        -   Cost (time)
        -   Implimentation
