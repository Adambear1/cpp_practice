Access Modifiers
-   Public
-   Private
-   Protected
Encapsulation
-   Bundling data/methods within a class.
-   Prevent anything outside of the class to access/modify such data and methods.
-   Only way to access is through process, to prevent errors.
-   Public methods to access private data [Getters + Setters]
Abstraction
-   Making a pure virtual function in a seperate class. Allows for multiple values/functions to operate when used.
-   Must define value/function when called.
Inheritence
-   Creating a parent (super) class with a child (sub/derived) class to base molds of previous forms of data passed.
-           IE: Car base/parent/super class share most commonalitis, but will differentiate when describe fuel/recharge rate.
-   Derived/Child class must have constructor as will to deviate from parent/super class.
-           REMEMBER: Constructor class (1) Has no return type (2) Must be same name as parent class (3) Must be public
Polymorphism
-   Object/Method has many forms.
-   Used primarly when a parent refers to a child class.
-   Method is stagnant/templated in parent class, but child class restructures/changes value/format when using/applying it.
-   Most recent derived version of function/method gets executed.
